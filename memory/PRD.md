# BMIA - Bharat Market Intel Agent

## Problem Statement
Build a Tier-1 Quant Analyst for Indian Equity and Commodity markets.

## What's Implemented (Latest: Apr 2026)

### Compliance — NotebookLM-style RAG over NSE/BSE/SEBI circulars (NEW, Apr 2026)
- Full page at `/compliance` + global quick-launch modal (sidebar button / `Ctrl+Shift+C`)
- 3 independent TF-IDF stores (one per source: NSE, BSE, SEBI) with adaptive `max_df` for small/large corpora
- **Production-ready ingestion** (`daemons/compliance_ingestion.py`):
  - 3 independent worker threads (one per source), each maintaining its own state in MongoDB `compliance_ingestion_state`
  - **Phased crawl**: `backfill` (most-recent → 2010, gentle 5-day pace) → `live` (last-30-days incremental every 15 min)
  - Date-ranged fetchers (NSE `from_date/to_date`, BSE `strFromDate/strToDate`, SEBI listing parse)
  - Tight timeouts (connect=5s, read=10-15s) + per-cycle PDF cap (`COMPLIANCE_MAX_PDFS_PER_CYCLE=10`) keep each cycle <5 min
  - Auto-rebuild TF-IDF after 50 new chunks or cycle 1-2
  - Polite `COMPLIANCE_REQUEST_DELAY_SEC=3s` between HTTP calls; all tunables exposed via env vars
  - Silent no-ops surfaced as `errors_count++` + `last_error` so UI accurately shows blocked sources
- RAG chat answered by Claude Sonnet 4.5 via `emergentintegrations` (`services/compliance_agent.py`), strict [CIT-N] citation format + `## Sources` list
- **"Cite in report"** one-click export on every answer: copies publication-ready markdown to clipboard with citations remapped to sequential `[1][2]…` (order of first appearance) + a numbered bibliography (circular no, date, title, category, URL). Auto-strips the LLM's inline Sources block. Ready to paste into email/PDF/Word.
- **Progress UI** in Compliance page & modal:
  - Overall phase badge (BACKFILL / LIVE) + per-source progress bars (BACKFILLING / LIVE)
  - Honest `progress_pct` = distinct years ingested ÷ total years span (2010 → today)
  - Per-source: years_covered, doc count, oldest-ingested date
  - Total circulars, vector chunks, overall %
  - Last-error banner appears when a source is blocked
  - Auto-poll: every 10s in backfill, 60s in live
  - Force-sync button for manual trigger
- Endpoints under `/api/compliance`:
  - `POST /research` — RAG query (question + sources[] + year_filter + top_k)
  - `GET /stats` — rich progress payload (overall_phase, totals, per-source phase/progress/errors)
  - `GET /circulars` — list ingested circulars with filters + pagination
  - `POST /rebuild` — manual TF-IDF rebuild
  - `POST /ingest-now` — manual ingestion trigger
- **Bulk Archive Upload (NEW, Feb 2026)** — bypasses cloud-IP rate limits on NSE/BSE/SEBI:
  - `POST /api/compliance/bulk-upload` — multipart ZIP of PDFs + `source` (nse/bse/sebi), max 500 MB. Returns `job_id` immediately.
  - `GET /api/compliance/bulk-upload/{job_id}` — job status + progress (processed/ingested/skipped/failed)
  - `GET /api/compliance/bulk-upload` — list recent jobs
  - Background worker (`_run_bulk_job`) extracts each PDF, parses optional `YYYY-MM-DD_<circ-no>_title.pdf` filename convention, ingests via same `_ingest_pdf_bytes` path as live scraper, rebuilds TF-IDF store once at end.
  - UI: `ComplianceBulkUploadModal.js` — source selector, file dropzone with .zip validation, upload button, recent jobs list with per-job progress bar + 3s polling (full test coverage at `/app/backend/tests/test_compliance_bulk_upload.py` — 7/7 pass)

- **External Scraper on SMIFS VPS (NEW, Apr 2026)** — unblocks NSE/BSE/SEBI cloud-IP blocks:
  - Dockerized FastAPI + Playwright service at `187.127.140.246:8765` (`/opt/bmia-scraper/`, image `bmia-scraper:latest`, 5.5 GB)
  - All three BMIA compliance fetchers route through it when `COMPLIANCE_SCRAPER_URL` is set; direct fallback when unset
  - NSE: `fromDate/toDate` camelCase unlocks full history (~500 circulars/month)
  - BSE: `AnnGetData/w` endpoint (compliance-filtered: Company Update, Insider Trading/SAST, Corp Action, AGM/EGM, Notice) + `AttachLive`↔`AttachHis` auto-fallback for historical PDFs
  - SEBI: Playwright-powered deep-crawl of all 10 Legal sections captured **3,039 items** spanning **1995–2026** (Circulars 2,763 / Master Circulars 133 / Regulations 58 / Gazette 34 / Guidelines 19 / Rules 18 / Acts 6 / General Orders 5 / Advisory 2 / Guidance Notes 1). Persisted to `/opt/bmia-scraper/cache/sebi_deep_cache.json` — survives restarts.
  - Scraper endpoints: `/fetch/{nse|bse|sebi}`, `/pdf` (PDF proxy with AttachLive↔AttachHis fallback), `/sebi/inventory`, `POST /sebi/deep-crawl`, `GET /sebi/deep-crawl/status`, `/probe`, `/health`. API-key auth via `X-API-Key`.
  - Code route: `_scraper_fetch()` + `_fetch_pdf_bytes()` in `compliance_ingestion.py`
  - Date-parser fixes: RFC822 + ISO-8601-with-T (handles BSE AnnGetData `DT_TM`).
- **Auto-migration on startup (NEW, Apr 2026)** — idempotent, runs once per deploy
  - Hook: `_run_auto_migrations()` in `server.py` lifespan
  - Migration `2026-04-scraper-v1`: fixes `year=None` rows, refreshes per-source oldest/newest cursors, resets SEBI to `phase=backfill, oldest=today, target=1995`, resets BSE to `target=2010`
  - Tracked in `compliance_migrations` collection; safe to redeploy any number of times
- **New admin endpoints** on `/api/compliance`:
  - `POST /backfill-dates` — manual re-parse of year=None rows
  - `POST /reset-source` — force a source back into backfill (body: `{source, target_start_year, force_from_today}`)

### Big Market — Koyfin-Style Global Dashboard
- 13 Indian indices, 15 global, 7 commodities, 7 currencies, 4 yields, Factor Grid, Stock Snapshot
- **Intel Tab (NEW, Apr 2026)** — 6 aggregators with zero data-source leakage in UI per user requirement:
  - Market Movers scatter (gainers/losers/high-volume, x=%chg y=vol z=traded-value)
  - Institutional Flows (FII/DII daily net cash + F&O contracts)
  - Earnings & Events calendar (NSE + BSE merged, configurable window)
  - Put-Call Ratio (Nifty + Bank Nifty OI-based with sentiment labels + expiry)
  - Analyst Estimates (CMP, P/E, ROE, Mcap, Book, Yield per ticker; live re-load)
  - Market News (multi-source RSS dedup, auto-refresh 5m)
- Endpoints: `GET /api/big-market/overview`, `/snapshot/{symbol}`, `/movers`, `/fii-dii`, `/earnings-calendar`, `/pcr`, `/analyst-estimates/{symbol}`, `/news`

### Core Platform
- Market Cockpit, Symbol Analysis, God Mode Scanner (NSE+BSE 3400+ stocks), AI Signals, BSE Guidance RAG

### 4-Model ML Ensemble + Monte Carlo
- LSTM, Attention-LSTM, GRU, GARCH (12s/stock)

### Portfolio System
- 6 AI portfolios + Custom, XIRR, P&L, Rebalance History
- HONEST P&L baseline vs immutable `initial_capital`; rebalance swaps preserve capital, realize P&L on exits
- SafeJSONResponse strips NaN/Inf → null
- PMS auto-reinvest (strategy-aware NIFTY-500 picker, no idle cash) + Exit History UI
- Market hours guard (IST 09:30-15:15 Mon-Fri, excl. NSE holidays)

### RAG & Intelligence
- 3-Month TF-IDF vectorization (25K+ vectors) for BSE Guidance
- GPT-4.1 → Gemini 2.5 Flash pipeline
- Daily Guidance Briefing on Cockpit
- Screener.in-style per-stock documents

### Auth & Audit
- OrgLens JWT + global fetch interceptor, audit log

## Backlog
- P2: CSV/PDF portfolio export
- P2: WebSocket/SSE real-time Cockpit (replace polling)
- P2: Exponential backoff in compliance_ingestion workers on repeated `no_data` cycles (BSE/SEBI are upstream-blocked from cloud IPs; errors_count grows unbounded today)
- Future: Portfolio push-alerts on rebalance/P&L thresholds
- Future: Benchmark comparison dashboard
- Future: Compliance "Save research" + Monday digest email
- Refactor: Rename TOTPGate.js → AuthGate.js
